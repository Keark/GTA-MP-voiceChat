# GTA-MP voice chat

GTA-MP-voiceChat is a voice chat package for the GTA V modification GTA-MP.

The first version will feature only the server side features because we can not
write the client side part currently.
But we will prepare as much as possible and adapt the client side part when GTA-MP gets released.
